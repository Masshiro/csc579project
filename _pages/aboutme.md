My name is Quanwei Zhang (张铨炜), and I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science. Before coming to Canada, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) (Nanjing, China) in 2021 and 2024, respectively.

I have a strong interest in learning languages. My native language is Mandarin Chinese, and I can communicate fluently in English. Additionally, I am interested in Japanese and eager to improve my proficiency in it.
